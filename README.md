ElectricImp/Arduino cloud based Moodlamp
==========================================

"ElectricImp/ Arduino Moodlamp" is a cloud based high power rgb led moodlamp which displays actual local temperature,
your personal Nike Fuelpoint status and you can change the colors with help of http interfaces. 
You needn't to use a high- power led for this, you can use every RGB- LED you like.
