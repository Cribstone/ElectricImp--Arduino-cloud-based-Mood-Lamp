ElectricImp--Arduino-cloud-based-Mood-Lamp
==========================================

ElectricImp/ Arduino is a cloud based high power rgb led moodlamp which displays actual local temperature,
your personal Nike Fuelpoint status and you can change the colors with help of http interfaces.

You'll find a german documentation here: http://www.photonik-campus.de/projects/electricimp-moodlamp-cloud-based/
This project is a contribution to the actual "Make Light"- contest from www.photonik-campus.de

I'm currently working on the english translation, which I want to publish at instructables.com in the near future, please be patient.
